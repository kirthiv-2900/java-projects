In today's fast-paced work environment, effective task management is essential for enhancing productivity and ensuring deadlines are met. 
 A task management system can streamline the process of assigning and tracking employee responsibilities by allowing companies to 
 input employee data—such as name and age—and categorize their tasks into Technical, Managerial, and Creative types. 
 Each task includes detailed attributes, such as descriptions and time limits defined in days, hours, minutes, and seconds. 
 This system also incorporates input validation to maintain data accuracy, ultimately fostering an organized approach to 
 managing employee tasks within an organization.
